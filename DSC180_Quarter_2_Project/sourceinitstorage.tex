Spectral entropy has high correlation with computing BCI compatibility (up to 89\%. Measures randomness or "peakiness" of a signal's frequency content.
Spectral entropy modulation is used as a decoder-independent proxy for neural controllability during motor imagery.

Lempel-Ziv should be a pretty good feature for determining a person’s BCI literacy, measures how many new patterns appear as a sequence unfolds. Also shows resting alpha power as being a good predictor

ERD is the core physiological mechanism underlying MI-BCIs, also shows SMR peak strength during rest correlates strongly with MI-BCI performance (r around 0.53)
