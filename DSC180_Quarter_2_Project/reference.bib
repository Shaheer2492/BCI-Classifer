abstract = {Background
Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems currently lack the required robustness for long-term daily use due to inter- and intra-subject performance variability. In this study, we propose a novel personalized scheme for a multimodal BCI system, primarily using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG), to identify, predict, and compensate for factors affecting competence-related and interfering factors associated with performance.
Method
11 (out of 13 recruited) participants, including five participants with motor deficits, completed four sessions on average. During the training sessions, the subjects performed a short pre-screening phase, followed by three variations of a novel visou-mental (VM) protocol. Features extracted from the pre-screening phase were used to construct predictive platforms using stepwise multivariate linear regression (MLR) models. In the test sessions, we employed a task-correction phase where our predictive models were used to predict the ideal task variation to maximize performance, followed by an interference-correction phase. We then investigated the associations between predicted and actual performances and evaluated the outcome of correction strategies.
Result
The predictive models resulted in respective adjusted R-squared values of 0.942, 0.724, and 0.939 for the first, second, and third variation of the task, respectively. The statistical analyses showed significant associations between the performances predicted by predictive models and the actual performances for the first two task variations, with rhos of 0.7289 (p-value = 0.011) and 0.6970 (p-value = 0.017), respectively. For 81.82 % of the subjects, the task/workload correction stage correctly determined which task variation provided the highest accuracy, with an average performance gain of 5.18 % when applying the correction strategies.
Conclusion
Our proposed method can lead to an integrated multimodal predictive framework to compensate for BCI performance variability, particularly, for people with severe motor deficits.}

ABSTRACT = {Motor imagery-based brain–computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) have great application prospects in motor enhancement and rehabilitation. However, the capacity to control a MI-BCI varies among persons. Predicting the MI ability of a user remains challenging in BCI studies. We first calculated the relative power level (RPL), power spectral entropy (PSE) and Lempel–Ziv complexity (LZC) of the resting-state open and closed-eye EEG of different frequency bands and investigated their correlations with the upper and lower limbs MI performance (left hand, right hand, both hands and feet MI tasks) on as many as 105 subjects. Then, the most significant related features were used to construct a classifier to separate the high MI performance group from the low MI performance group. The results showed that the features of open-eye resting alpha-band EEG had the strongest significant correlations with MI performance. The PSE performed the best among all features for the screening of the MI performance, with the classification accuracy of 85.24%. These findings demonstrated that the alpha bands might offer information related to the user’s MI ability, which could be used to explore more effective and general neural markers to screen subjects and design individual MI training strategies.},

ABSTRACT={Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines—but does not perform—a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as “BCI-inefficiency,” in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1: r = 0.54; Session 2: r = 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared = 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time. }}
