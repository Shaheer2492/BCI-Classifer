QUICK CRITICAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY
======================================================================

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULT
--------------------------------------------------
Research Question: Does real/imagined similarity predict BCI compatibility?

Sample size: 109 subjects
Correlation: r = -0.031
Significance: p = 0.7476 (not significant)
R-squared: 0.001 (0.1% variance explained)

VERDICT: ⚠ HYPOTHESIS NOT SUPPORTED
No significant correlation between similarity and BCI performance.


BCI PERFORMANCE STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------
Mean accuracy: 73.4% ± 4.3%
Median accuracy: 73.5%
Range: 64.6% - 90.9%

BCI-compatible (>70%): 91 (83.5%)
BCI-incompatible (<60%): 0 (0.0%)


RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1. Your similarity metric may not be the right biomarker
2. Try other features: beta power, lateralization, SNR
3. Consider multivariate approach (multiple features)
4. Investigate individual good/poor performers for patterns
